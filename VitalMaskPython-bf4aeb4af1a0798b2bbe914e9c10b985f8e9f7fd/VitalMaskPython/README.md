# Look at me! I'm playing with Markdown!
## Anyway, welcome to what will be v2 of the VitalMask desktop application. Now in Python!

First you will need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You will also need a Python IDE. I Recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Python extension.

Next, you will need the dependencies.

To make sure you have the latest pip tools: 
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools virtualenv
```
To install Kivy dependencoes:
```bash
python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy_deps.sdl2==0.1.* kivy_deps.glew==0.1
```
To install Kivy:
```bash
python -m pip install kivy==1.11.1
```
To install BLEAK:
```bash
pip install bleak
```

^This list will be updated according to our needs.

Anyway, now clone this repo, open it in a Python IDE, and you're in business!
